# Captcha-App
Welcome to the CAPTCHA App repository! This project is a simple yet effective implementation of a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CAPTCHAs are widely used in web applications to prevent automated bots from performing actions that are meant for human users, such as signing up for accounts or submitting forms.

Features:

->Generates random CAPTCHA challenges consisting of alphanumeric characters
->User-friendly interface for easy interaction
->Built-in validation to confirm user input against the generated CAPTCHA
->Customizable design through CSS styling

Usage:
To use this CAPTCHA app, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. The app will generate a new CAPTCHA challenge each time the page is loaded or refreshed. Users can then type in the displayed characters into the input field and submit their response. If the response matches the generated CAPTCHA, the user will receive a success message; otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
